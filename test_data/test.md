# Sample Markdown with LaTeX

This is a sample markdown file with a math formula.

## Introduction

We can write inline math like this: 

$$
E=mc^2
$$.

And block math using double dollar signs:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## Key Concepts

- Markdown is easy to write
- LaTeX is great for math
- Together, they make documentation powerful

## Another Formula

Let's look at the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}
$$

That's all!
